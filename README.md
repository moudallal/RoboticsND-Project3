This repository contains the files for Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree's Third Project.

Find Udacity's Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209).

## Project Requirements

- Simulate previous robot inside a simulation world
- Set up AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)
- Generate a map using PGM from the simulation world
- Launch `map_server`, `amcl`, and `move_base` nodes
- Achieve relatively fast robot localization 
- Control robot using `teleop`

<!-- The requirements of this project were met as approved by Udacity's reviewers. -->
